# ðŸ’¾ NightreignSaveManager

## Description

This is a simple save manager for Nightreign. I wanted something that let me retain my progress when playing duos. Features include the ability to backup, archive, and convert save files into Seemless compatible .co2 formats.
[When converting a save from a Seemless save file back into a Vanilla one USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. Seemless saves have a chance to be flagged and banned from online use as we are not sure what may be modified differently from Vanilla.]
